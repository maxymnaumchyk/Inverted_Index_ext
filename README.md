Two programs were developed in the Python programming language: <br />
Inverted_index builder - builds and stores an inverted index in a file <br />
Python Server - stores the inverted index and searches it at the request of the server in C#. <br />

In C#, a client-server application was developed using network sockets that can access the python server by sending a set of words to search for and get a list of documents in which this set of words occurs.
